## About
This is a project that I developed in Week 5 of MIT xPro Bootcamp. MIT provided starter code for basic operations.

>**Skills Highlighted**:
1. Use a JavaScript library to render a map on a web page.
2. Build and manipulate a map on a web page.
3. Bind DOM elements to mouse events.
4. Use JavaScript to dynamically display data on a web page.
5. Use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to set web page styles.

>**Assignment Tasks**:
1. Acquire and apply an access token for JavaScript library of maps.
2. Set button to create a marker and add it to the map using the library's pre-built functions in response to click by the user.
3. Refresh the real-time location of a bus every several seconds and mark its current location on the map.

>**Custom features**:
1. Made the Boston map center itself on first render, using the initial coordinates of the current location of the bus -- prior to any click of the button.
2. Added an overlaid title to the map.
3. Added current date/time stamp to the map
4. Positioned and styled the button that begins real-time tracking.

## How to Run <img src='https://github.com/edwaggoner/real-time-bus-tracker/blob/main/Real-time-bus-tracker-logo2.png' alt='Bus Tracker logo' width='30'>
1. Click the "Show Boston Route 1 Bus" to initiate real-time tracking.

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Display real-time locations for additional buses that run the same route.
- [ ] Display the identifying number of each bus that is being tracked.
- [ ] Use multi-color markers to show the location of each additioal bus.
