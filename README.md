## About
This is a project that I developed in Week 5 of MIT xPro Bootcamp. MIT provided starter code that included unstyled "Add PacMan" and "Start Game" buttons and placed one motionless PacMan on the screen.

>**Skills Highlighted**:
1. Bind DOM elements to mouse events.
2. Use JavaScript to dynamically display data on a web page.
3. Create an animated effect by toggling images.
4. Use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to set web page styles.

>**Assignment Tasks**:
1. Make a new PacMan appear at a random position on the screen when user clicks the "Add PacMan" button.
2. Make each PacMan that is created start moving at a random velocity when user clicks the "Start Game" button.
3. Make each PacMan appear to be chomping as it moves across the screen.
4. Make each PacMan bounce upon impact with the top/bottom edge of the screen.
5. Make each PacMan reverse direction when it hits the left/right edge of the screen.
6. Make the face of each PacMan align with its current direction along the horizontal axis.

## How to Run <img src='https://github.com/edwaggoner/pac-men-factory/blob/main/Pac-men-thumbnail3.png' alt='PacMen logo' width='30'>
1. Click the "Add PacMan" button to place an initial PacMan on the screen. Create as many initial PacMen as you wish.
2. Click the "Start Game" button once to set your PacMan (or PacMen) in motion.
3. Each further click of the "Add PacMan" button will add another PacMan that will move immediately.

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Make the "Add PacMan" button select randomly from a set of differently styled PacMen.
- [ ] Add a button that increases the velocity of the PacMen on the screen.
- [ ] Replace the "Start Game" button with one that toggles between "Play" and "Pause".
- [ ] Style the playing field with a background image.
